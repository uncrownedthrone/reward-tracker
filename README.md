# Capstone - Reward Tracker

I have created a reward tracking system that is geared towards distributing and tracking student rewards for a school. Both teachers and students would have access to this system. The teacher will be able to create periods, add/remove students, and add/redeem rewards. The student will be able to check their balances and see their redemption history.

My wife is a high school English teacher whose school has a reward system where any teacher can give “points” to students as a reward for good behavior. The student can then redeem the points from any teacher for a special privilege, such as five minutes of using their phone at the end of a class or add points to their overall grade.

The current tracking system used at her school is clunky, unintuitive and is only available on the teacher's desktop computer. I created a responsive reward system tracker that can be used on a mobile device or a desktop. This enables teachers and students to pull up real-time data about their rewards and do so wherever they may be on campus.

TODO

- add students by period? teacher?
- connect student page to link somewhere?
- find out why teacher is being duplicated
- find out why collapsible is only collapsing in one area
- get add and redeem buttons working
- link add and redeem buttons to students
- add ability to view reward record history for adding/redeeming
