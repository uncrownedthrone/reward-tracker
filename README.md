# Capstone - Reward Tracker

I have created a reward tracking system that is currently geared towards distributing and tracking student rewards for a high school.

My wife is a high school English teacher whose school has a reward system where any teacher can give “bucks” to students as a reward for good behavior. Then, the student can redeem the bucks from any teacher for a special privilege, such as five minutes of listening to music on their phone at the end of a class.

The current tracking system is clunky, unintuitive and generally, not user friendly, so I set out to make a responsive reward system tracker. In addition, it’s responsive so it scales for use on either a desktop, tablet, or phone. This enables teachers and students to pull up real-time data about their rewards and do so wherever they may be on campus.

This project will use the following technologies:

- React.js
- React Router
- C#
- PostgreSQL
- ASP.NET Core
- HTML5
- CSS
